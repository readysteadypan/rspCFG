# Ready Steady Pan CFGs
Configs for Ready Steady Pan

# Information

These configs are in use as of Season 3 of Ready Steady Pan. These are the most up to date configs.

The current version is Version 1.7.3, updated last on 25th September 2017. The config was first used in Preseason of Season 3 of Ready Steady Pan. Please direct any queries directly about the configs either in the Issues of this repository or in the Ready Steady Pan [Discord](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?url=http://discord.gg/2Jzr43T).

We strongly recommend server owners to use the tftrue plugin if they can, along with the official melee plugin.

# Installation

Server owners should download the zip for this repository by clicking the green "Clone or Download" button on the top right, underneath "1 contributor." Then, you should copy the (unzipped) files to your server using FTP (or scp, sFTP, whatever protocol you use). Execute these configs by opening the console, providing an rcon password, and typing:

```
rcon exec rsp_koth
```

...or the name of the config required per map.
